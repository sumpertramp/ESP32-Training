Description:
   The code creates a TCP server operating on a specified IP address and port 
number. The server listens for incoming connections and accepts each connection. 
Once a connection is established, the server continuously receives data and prints 
it to the screen. If the client closes the connection, the server prints this 
information to the screen and continues to wait for the next connection.

NOT! Make sure you enter the correct server IP.
